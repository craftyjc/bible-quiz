## Loading Custom Quiz Questions

### Method 1: Browser Console
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Use the `loadCustomQuizData()` function:

```javascript
// Your quiz data
const myQuizData = [
    {
        "question": "What is the capital of Japan?",
        "options": ["Tokyo", "Osaka", "Kyoto", "Hiroshima"],
        "correct": 0
    },
    // ... more questions
];

// Load the data
loadCustomQuizData(myQuizData);
```

### Method 2: JSON File
Create a JSON file with your questions and load it programmatically:

```json
[
    {
        "question": "Your question here?",
        "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
        "correct": 2
    },
    {
        "question": "Another question?",
        "options": ["Choice 1", "Choice 2", "Choice 3", "Choice 4"],
        "correct": 0
    }
]
```

## JSON Format Requirements

Each question object must have:
- `question`: The question text (string)
- `options`: Array of exactly 4 answer choices (strings)
- `correct`: Index of the correct answer (0-3, where 0 is the first option)

### Example:
```json
{
    "question": "What is 2 + 2?",
    "options": ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    "correct": 1
}
```
‚òùÔ∏è In this example, "4" is correct (index 1 in the options array)
